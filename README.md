## Chat Tab

Your AI coding assistant for Unity development.

### Features
- **Ask Questions**: Get answers about Unity APIs, C# patterns, best practices
- **Explain Code**: Select any script and ask AI to explain what it does
- **Generate Scripts**: Describe what you need, AI generates complete C# scripts
- **Fix Errors**: Paste console errors, AI suggests fixes
- **Context Aware**: AI sees your selected scripts, GameObjects, and scene hierarchy

### Actions
| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| Ask | Send a custom question with selected context |
| Explain | Explain the selected code |
| Review | Code review with suggestions |
| Optimize | Performance optimization suggestions |
| Document | Generate XML documentation comments |
| Fix Errors | Analyze console errors and suggest fixes |

### Response Panel
- **Copy**: Copy AI response to clipboard
- **Apply**: Save AI-generated code directly to a script file
- **Clear**: Clear the response

---

## Search Tab

Semantic search across your entire codebase.

### Features
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask "Where is player health managed?" instead of searching for keywords
- **Project-Wide Index**: Indexes all C# scripts in your project
- **Ranked Results**: Most relevant results shown first
- **Click to Open**: Jump directly to the file and line

### How to Use
1. Click **Build Index** to scan your project scripts
2. Type your question in the search box
3. Click results to open files in your IDE

---

## Analyze Tab

One-click scene performance and hygiene analysis.

### What it Checks
- **Performance Issues**: Large meshes, too many lights, expensive shaders
- **Missing References**: Null references in components
- **Inactive Objects**: Hidden objects that might be forgotten
- **Best Practices**: Naming conventions, layer usage, tag consistency

### Output
Generates a detailed report with:
- Issue severity (Warning, Error, Info)
- Affected GameObject names
- Suggested fixes

---

## Actions Tab (Experimental)

Execute commands directly in your Unity scene without writing code.

### 🤖 AI Actions (NEW)
Describe complex setups in natural language - AI generates and executes all actions.

**Example requests:**
- "Create a first-person player with camera and movement"
- "Build a physics playground with ramps and bouncy balls"
- "Set up a simple enemy that patrols between waypoints"

**Workflow:**
1. Type your request in the AI Actions input
2. Click "Ask AI" - AI generates an action plan
3. Preview the actions before execution
4. Click "Execute All" to build the setup

### Command Input
Type natural language commands:
- "Create a Cube at (0, 5, 0)"
- "Add Rigidbody to selected"
- "Create red material"

### Quick Actions
One-click buttons for common operations:

| Category | Actions |
|----------|---------|
| **Primitives** | Cube, Sphere, Capsule, Cylinder, Plane |
| **Components** | + Rigidbody, + BoxCollider, + Light, + AudioSource |
| **Materials** | Red, Green, Blue, Yellow |

### Templates
Pre-built setups that create multiple objects at once:

| Template | What it creates |
|----------|----------------|
| FPS Player | Capsule + CharacterController |
| Third Person Player | Capsule + Rigidbody + Collider |
| Physics Cube | Cube + Rigidbody |
| Bouncy Ball | Sphere + Rigidbody |
| Point Light | Empty + Light component |
| Basic Enemy | Capsule + Rigidbody + Collider |
| Trigger Zone | Cube + BoxCollider |
| Audio Source | Empty + AudioSource |

### Smart Suggestions
Context-aware action buttons that change based on your selection:
- No selection → Create Cube, Sphere, Empty
- Object with Renderer → Add Rigidbody, Add Collider, Apply Material
- Light selected → Adjust intensity, change type

---

## Refactor Tab

Navigate and refactor your codebase with safety checks.

### Navigation Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Symbol Search** | Find classes, methods, fields, properties by name |
| **Go to Definition** | Jump to where a symbol is declared |
| **Find References** | List all usages of a symbol across the project |
| **Call Hierarchy** | See what methods call this method, and what it calls |

### Refactoring Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Rename** | Rename symbols with all references updated |
| **Preview** | Side-by-side diff before applying changes |

### Safety System
Protects against dangerous refactorings:

| Risk Level | Meaning | Examples |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Low | Safe local change | Private methods, local variables |
| Medium | Review recommended | Public APIs, SerializeField |
| High | Blocked | Start(), Update(), OnCollisionEnter() |

### How to Use
1. Click **Build Index** to scan your project
2. Search for a symbol name
3. Click a result to select it
4. Use navigation buttons (Go to Definition, Find References, etc.)
5. For renaming: enter new name → Preview → Apply

## Settings Tab

Configure AI provider and generation parameters.

### AI Provider
| Provider | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Local** | Offline inference using llama.cpp (requires model download) |
| **Gemini** | Google's Gemini API (requires API key) |
